# Assignment 1: Web Application Mimicking Google Sheets

## Objective
Develop a web application that closely mimics the user interface and core functionalities of Google Sheets, with a focus on mathematical and data quality functions, data entry, and key UI interactions.

## Features

### 1. Spreadsheet Interface
- **Mimic Google Sheets UI**: Strive for a visual design and layout that closely resembles Google Sheets, including the toolbar, formula bar, and cell structure.
- **Drag Functions**: Implement drag functionality for cell content, formulas, and selections to mirror Google Sheets' behavior.
- **Cell Dependencies**: Ensure that formulas and functions accurately reflect cell dependencies and update accordingly when changes are made to related cells.
- **Basic Cell Formatting**: Support for bold, italics, font size, and color.
- **Row and Column Management**: Ability to add, delete, and resize rows and columns.

### 2. Mathematical Functions
Implement the following mathematical functions:
- **SUM**: Calculates the sum of a range of cells.
- **AVERAGE**: Calculates the average of a range of cells.
- **MAX**: Returns the maximum value from a range of cells.
- **MIN**: Returns the minimum value from a range of cells.
- **COUNT**: Counts the number of cells containing numerical values in a range.

### 3. Data Quality Functions
Implement the following data quality functions:
- **TRIM**: Removes leading and trailing whitespace from a cell.
- **UPPER**: Converts the text in a cell to uppercase.
- **LOWER**: Converts the text in a cell to lowercase.
- **REMOVE_DUPLICATES**: Removes duplicate rows from a selected range.
- **FIND_AND_REPLACE**: Allows users to find and replace specific text within a range of cells.

### 4. Data Entry and Validation
- **Data Input**: Allow users to input various data types (numbers, text, dates).
- **Data Validation**: Implement basic data validation checks (e.g., ensuring numeric cells only contain numbers).

### 5. Testing
- **User Testing**: Provide a means for users to test the implemented functions with their own data.
- **Result Display**: Display the results of function execution clearly.

## Bonus Features
- Implement additional mathematical and data quality functions.
- Add support for more complex formulas and cell referencing (e.g., relative and absolute references).
- Allow users to save and load their spreadsheets.
- Incorporate data visualization capabilities (e.g., charts, graphs).

## Evaluation Criteria
- **Fidelity to Google Sheets UI**: How closely the application's look and feel matches Google Sheets, including drag functions and cell dependency handling.
- **Functionality and Completeness**: The completeness of the implemented features.
- **Accuracy**: The accuracy of the mathematical and data quality functions.
- **Usability**: The usability and intuitiveness of the user interface.
- **Code Quality**: The quality and maintainability of the code.
- **Bonus Features**: Implementation of bonus features.

## Data Structures and Tech Stack
- **Data Structures**: Explain the data structures used for managing spreadsheet data, such as arrays, objects, or custom data structures.
- **Tech Stack**: Detail the technologies used in the project, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any libraries or frameworks (e.g., React, Angular, Vue.js) and the reasons for choosing them.
